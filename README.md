# <center>Public Playground Managment System (PPMS)</center>

**Objective**: The goal of this assignment is to develop a comprehensive Public Playground Management System (PPMS) that enables the management and maintenance of public playgrounds. This system will be built using a combination of .NET for the backend, React for the frontend, and HTMX for enhanced interactivity. The system will facilitate the tracking of playgrounds, scheduling of maintenance activities, and management of user feedback.

**Project Overview**: The PPMS is designed to streamline the administration of public playgrounds. It will provide features for registering and updating playgrounds, scheduling and tracking maintenance, and managing user interactions and feedback. The system will include a user-friendly interface and robust backend services to support efficient playground management.
